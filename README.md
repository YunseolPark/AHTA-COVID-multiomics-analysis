# Omics analysis on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in human patients and human cell lines

SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of the
worldwide pandemic, COVID-19. Its symptoms range
from asymptotic to inflammatory responses to even
death. In this report, we collected different omics data
on SARS-CoV-2 infection in human patients and cell
lines. Multi-omics data analyses can aid in elucidating
the pathology of the disease. As such, we made use of
a genomic dataset, two transcriptomic datasets, and an
epigenomic dataset to grant insight into the mechanisms
underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection in human hosts.
Through these analyses, we found that there are significant differences between healthy donors and COVID-
19 patients, mostly concerning genes involved in the
immune response, cell cycle, and protein production
and processing. A significant gene found commonly
in three of the four analyses is DUSP1. This gene is
involved in the immune response and the MAPK signalling pathway, and has already been described within
the context of SARS-CoV-2 pathology previously.

The SRA accession of the two RNA-seq data and the ChIP-seq are in the bash files.
